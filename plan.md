Here is the current task


I want to run test the latest python 3.14.0 freethreaded version
Check the  versions-manifest.json and see where the free threaded version of python 3.14.0 is available.
Make changes to the testing matrix, so that the supported OS and architecture for the freethreaded python in installed and these new tests for this os and arch, along with all old tests work

Please introduce minimal changes to get this done and be clear and concise
